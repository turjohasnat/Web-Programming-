# Web-Programming-
Solutions for my university’s Web Programming course are available here, including all midterm questions and most final topics. Due to the national election in Bangladesh, our semester was shortened, so JavaScript wasn’t taught. That’s why the final exam’s JavaScript solutions are not included, but all other topics are covered.
