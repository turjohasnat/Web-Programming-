#📘 Web Programming Course Solutions

This repository contains a well-organized collection of solutions for my university’s Web Programming course. It includes complete answers to all midterm examination questions and covers almost all topics from the final examination syllabus.

Due to the national election in Bangladesh, the academic semester was shortened. As a result, JavaScript was not included in our coursework. Therefore, solutions related to JavaScript from the final examination are not available in this collection.

However, all other core topics covered throughout the course have been carefully solved and documented. This repository is intended to serve as a helpful academic resource for revision, practice, and concept clarification.
